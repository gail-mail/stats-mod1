We manufacture these means to ensure they will reflect the pattern we need to create misleading data.\n",

We also increase overall, academic, and social ratings, making it seem as though these changes are caused by lack of AA when really it is normal life without the pandemic. Diversity also goes down due to sampling bias from more white folks."
